Hey! Let’s break down **Cap**, an Easy Linux machine on HackTheBox that revolves around insecure direct object references (IDOR), cleartext credential exposure in PCAP files, and dangerous binary capabilities.

## 1. Reconnaissance

I started off running a standard Nmap scan against the target IP to see what ports and services were running:

```bash
nmap -sVC -p- 10.129.93.39
```

The scan came back with **3 open TCP ports**:
* **Port 21**: FTP (`vsftpd 3.0.3`)
* **Port 22**: SSH (`OpenSSH 8.2p1`)
* **Port 80**: HTTP running a Gunicorn web server titled "Security Dashboard"

## 2. Enumeration & Finding the IDOR

Popping open the web browser to `http://10.129.93.39`, I landed on the Security Dashboard. Clicking around the sidebar, I triggered a feature called "Security Snapshot," which ran a quick packet capture and redirected my browser to `http://10.129.93.39/data/1`.

Noticing the `/1` at the end of the URL, I wondered if it was vulnerable to IDOR. I manually changed the URL path to `/data/0`. Sure enough, it loaded another user's private scan report containing 72 captured packets! The application didn't validate whether the logged-in user actually owned the requested ID, letting me browse other users' scans freely.

## 3. Exploitation & Getting a Shell

Inside the scan data at `/data/0`, there was an option to download a packet capture file named `0.pcap`. I pulled it down and opened it up in Wireshark to see what was hidden inside.

Filtering through the stream, I spotted unencrypted **FTP** traffic. Following the TCP stream revealed a login attempt where user `nathan` sent their password in cleartext:
* **Username**: `nathan`
* **Password**: `Buck3tH4TFORM3!`

Since port 22 (SSH) was open, I tested these credentials there. Logging in via SSH worked instantly:

```bash
ssh nathan@10.129.93.39
```

Once inside, I grabbed the user flag right away:
* **User Flag**: `7074363d194f7b877e87a5cee7c52499`

## 4. Privilege Escalation

To figure out how to escalate to root, I checked for files with special Linux capabilities assigned to them using `getcap`:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

The output flagged something very interesting: `/usr/bin/python3.8` had the `cap_setuid` capability enabled (`cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip`). This means the python binary can change its user ID during execution, effectively allowing a normal user to spawn a root-level process.

I leveraged this capability to pop a root shell with a quick one-liner:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
```

Running `whoami` confirmed I was running as `root`. I navigated to the root directory and grabbed the final flag:
